# algorithms_stack_c
This repository provides some really popular algorithms in an easy to use manner . The aim is to make available working C codes of some popular algorithms . 

##Expected Users
People who are working on projects with crucial time constraints and do not have the time to convert pseudo code available from many sources to C code (i did find this to be tough task in many cases) . Those who do have time are always suggested to do it themselves without taking the help of this repository (you will learn a lot while doing so) . Understanding the algorithm is always useful .
