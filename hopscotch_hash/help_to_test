please make the changes in the following in hopscotch.h depending on the amount of data 
that is to added in the hash table
	1)HOP_SIZE
	2)ADDR_RANGE
	3)BUCKET_MASK_BITS
	4)bucket_mask
	5)segments_arr["this value to be upper bound since resize is invoked automatically"][ADDR_RANGE]

credits to Melissa O'Neill for making the pcg_basic.c file available online 
which is the file that contains the declaration and definition of data type 
pcg32_random_t and function pcg32_boundedrand_r(pcg_random_t *,uint32_t upperbound)
and pcg32_srandom_r() used in main1.c to generate the test files

to run the test 
gcc main1.c pcg_basic.c
	main1.c - contains the code used to generate the test cases 
	pcg_basic.c - generates random numbers which is used by main1.c
./a.out > ./test3/testfile
	stores the test case in file ./test3/testfile
gcc main.c
	this contains the intial code that drives the hopscotch.c
	by providing it with required input
./a.out < ./test3/testfile > ./test3/testresult
	./test3/testresult is used since on testing the program with large 
	amounts of data for every operation the result is printed so storing 
	in the file prevents flooding the terminal
