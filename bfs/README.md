#Minimum Requirements
Each node should be of type vertex whose specs are given in **main.c **. More data types can be put in the struct of type vertex depending on the demands of program for which this logic is being used in.

####The following is the format in which the contents of the testfile should be for the demo to work properly
<*node*> <*connected to with space separating the connected nodes*>
1 5 4 6<*space*><*enter*>
2 3 6<*space*><*enter*>
3 2 6<*space*><*enter*>
4 1 5<*space*><*enter*>
5 4 1<*space*><*enter*>
6 1 2 3<*space*><*enter*>
