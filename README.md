# algorithms_stack_c
this repository provides some really popular algorithms in an easy to use manner .
the aim is to make available working C codes of some popular algorithms 

##Expected Users
people who are working on projects with crucial time constraints and do not have the time to convert pseudocode available from many sources to C code (i did find this to be tough task in many cases). those who do have time are always suggested to do it themselves without taking the help of this repository (you will learn a lot while doing so).
